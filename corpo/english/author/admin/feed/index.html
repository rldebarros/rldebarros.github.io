				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>O Corpo</em> tells the story of two men having to deal with a dead body and concomitantly with their own bodies and their vivid significations. The body is dead but very much alive in the boundless limitations they inherently possess, searching in the unknown depth for that which can, for a meager moment, escape the noiseless pacing of the inevitable, resulting in a brutal and endless fall upon the trivial. In this fall, the characters lose themselves in idle conversation, doing nothing about the desperate situation at hand. The battle of the situation that assails them is paled by the helplessness in their projected solutions: escape is deeply installed within consciousness, and consciousness found in the boundaries of the body. The rigid inarticulate nullity in the core of our collective desperation turns us to the simultaneous singularity and vulgarity of our own experience: blindly dwindling, dangling our rigid skeletons to and from, easing our heads upon the pillows of ignorance and degradation, the violence of our eager need for constant compensations for our own inabilities, our own disabilities. This headless body that does articulate its limbs has inscribed in its landscape from the moment of conception the certainty of death. This “dead body” in the story is the very entrapment presented by the impossibility of clear visualization of this blurry certainty. And as such, the characters wallow in an endless nothingness, devoid of measurable time, subjected to an alternation between consciousness of the situation’s gravity and the escapism of triviality.</p>
